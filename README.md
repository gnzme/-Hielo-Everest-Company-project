# -Hielo-Everest-Company-project

Hielo Everest, a Chilean ice production company, faces a strategic crossroads. While balancing artisanal "art ice" and mechanized ice production, it struggles with efficiency and scalability in its "art ice" line. 
The highly valued "art ice" is manually produced, requiring significant time and human resources. The growing demand presents both an opportunity and a challenge: how to maintain quality and uniqueness while improving production efficiency? 
This project aims to explore automation using molds to increase efficiency and consistency, ensuring Hielo Everest meets demand without compromising quality. This report details methods, research, and recommendations for this modernization.
